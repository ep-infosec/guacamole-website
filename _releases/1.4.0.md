The 1.4.0 release features support for connection tiling, broadcasting keyboard
events across multiple connections, and authentication with encrypted and
signed JSON. Established support for single sign-on has been improved,
multi-touch support for RDP has been added, and problems with audio input
support for RDP have been corrected. For a full list of all changes in this
release, please see the [changelog](#changelog).

**The 1.4.0 release is compatible with older 1.x components.** You should
upgrade older components to 1.4.0 when possible, however things should continue
to work correctly in the interim:

* Extensions written for older 1.x releases can be used by 1.4.0.
* Components written for the version of the Guacamole protocol used by older
  1.x releases can be used with components of the 1.4.0 release.

Regardless of inter-component compatibility, **there are changes in 1.4.0 which
may affect downstream users of Guacamole's APIs**. Please see the [deprecation
/ compatibility notes](#deprecation--compatibility-notes) section for more
information.


Connection tiling and keyboard broadcasting
-------------------------------------------

[Multiple connections can now be displayed simultaneously within the same
browser tab](/doc/1.4.0/gug/using-guacamole.html#switching-and-tiling-connections),
automatically arranged in an even, tiled layout:

![Multiple client displays in a tiled arrangement](/doc/1.4.0/gug/_images/client-tiled.png)

The currently-focused connection is indicated by a blue border, and the user
can choose to focus any number of these tiled connections at the same time.
**If multiple connections are focused, keyboard interaction is broadcast across
each of those connections.**

Major fixes to RDP audio input support
--------------------------------------

Depending on the application in use within the remote desktop, Guacamole's
audio input support for RDP suffered from quality issues related to variability
in audio buffer behavior and size. If the audio backend used by the application
could not adjust for occasional bursts of audio packets, any audio packets
received by the remote desktop that exceeded the remaining buffer space would
be dropped, resulting in audible clicks/pops and faster-than-expected playback.

This has now been corrected. Guacamole will automatically throttle the amount
of data it sends to the remote desktop to avoid running out of remote buffer
space, ensuring the audio received by applications within the remote desktop is
identical to the audio received by Guacamole via the browser.

RDP support for passing through multi-touch events
--------------------------------------------------

In addition to Guacamole's established support for emulating a mouse on touch
devices, multi-touch events may now be passed through to the remote desktop
server when supported and enabled.

RDP supports multi-touch through its "RDPEI" channel. [If touch is enabled on a
Guacamole RDP connection](/doc/1.4.0/gug/configuring-guacamole.html#device-redirection),
touch interaction with the Guacamole display will directly affect touch-enabled
applications within the remote desktop session rather than being turned into
mouse events.

Support for secondary SSO providers
-----------------------------------

Guacamole's support for single sign-on has historically been all-or-nothing,
with either _all_ users using SSO to authenticate or none at all. This is no
longer the case: Guacamole may now be configured to allow normal
username/password authentication in addition to SSO, and multiple SSO providers
may be used at the same time.

Whether an SSO authentication extension automatically takes effect for all
users depends on whether that extension has priority, which can now be defined
using [the `extension-priority` property](/doc/1.4.0/gug/configuring-guacamole.html#guacamole-properties).
For example, to automatically require SAML for all users, you would give the
SAML extension priority above all others:

    extension-priority: saml

Or, to allow username/password authentication and simply provide the option for
users to use SAML, you would ensure that other extensions have priority:

    extension-priority: *, saml

More information on [using the `extension-priority` property](/doc/1.4.0/gug/configuring-guacamole.html#guacamole-properties)
and controlling the behavior of the supported SSO extensions can be found in
the Guacamole manual:

 * [CAS Authentication](/doc/1.4.0/gug/cas-auth.html)
 * [OpenID Connect Authentication](/doc/1.4.0/gug/openid-auth.html)
 * [SAML Authentication](/doc/1.4.0/gug/saml-auth.html)

Support for authentication with encrypted, signed JSON
------------------------------------------------------

The "guacamole-auth-json" authentication extension, [formerly a third-party
project maintained by Glyptodon](https://github.com/glyptodon/guacamole-auth-json),
has now been brought into Apache Guacamole as one of the project's own
extensions.

guacamole-auth-json allows external software to automatically authenticate and
authorize users with an encrypted and signed JSON document. As long as the
received JSON has not expired and was encrypted and signed with the correct
key, it is accepted as sufficient verification that the user is authorized to
access the resources described by that JSON.

For more information, see the [documentation covering guacamole-auth-json in
the Guacamole manual](/doc/1.4.0/gug/json-auth.html).

Deprecation / Compatibility notes
=================================

Each 1.x release of Apache Guacamole should be compatible with components of
older 1.x releases. This compatibility is intended at the Guacamole protocol
level and at the extension level, but not necessarily at the API level. This
means:

 * Extensions from older 1.x releases should still work in binary form, but may
   need code changes before their source will build against a newer version of
   guacamole-ext.
 * Software which uses the Guacamole protocol of an older 1.x release should
   still work.
 * Software which uses libguac from an older 1.x release should still work by
   continuing to use the libguac from that release, as newer versions of
   libguac may not be API/ABI compatible. In the case of third-party protocol
   support plugins for guacd, this means that the guacd from that release must
   also be used. Compatibility with respect to libguac is represented by the
   [soname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soname).
 * You should update to newer versions where applicable and when possible.

As of 1.4.0, the following changes have been made which affect compatibility
with past releases:


Java API (guacamole-common) changes
-----------------------------------

### `GuacamoleHTTPTunnelServlet` sessions are now decoupled from the `GuacamoleTunnel` UUID

The `GuacamoleHTTPTunnelServlet` internals have been improved to entirely
decouple the concept of the tunnel UUID (as returned by `getUUID()`) from the
concept of the HTTP tunnel session. The HTTP tunnel now instead generates its
own random session identifier that is independent of the UUID.

Internal, UUID-specific functions of `GuacamoleHTTPTunnelServlet` like
`registerTunnel()` and `deregisterTunnel()` have been deprecated in favor of
versions of these functions that do not assume the tunnel will be identified by
its UUID. It is not common to use these functions in subclasses of
`GuacamoleHTTPTunnelServlet`. Any such usages should continue to work, but
should be migrated to the new versions of these functions when possible.

 * [GUACAMOLE-956](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-956) - Migrate away from including auth token within REST API URLs

Extension API (guacamole-ext) changes
-------------------------------------

### Default `LocalEnvironment` constructor is now deprecated

To facilitate automatic retrieval of `guacamole.properties` values from key
vaults, the `Environment` interface has been improved to allow arbitrary
sources of properties to be added, and the `LocalEnvironment` implementation
has been updated to be a singleton. New usages should invoke
`LocalEnvironment.getInstance()` instead of manually creating new instances.

Old usages of the default constructor will still work as expected, but will
produce a compile-time warning about deprecation. The old default constructor
will still create a new `LocalEnvironment` instance, however this new instance
will actually transparently delegate to the `LocalEnvironment.getInstance()`
singleton.

Note that while completion of vault support has been bumped to the next
release, this core API improvement is still present on 1.4.0.

 * [GUACAMOLE-641](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-641) - Support storage of sensitive data within key vaults

libguac API changes
-------------------

### `touch_handler` added to `guac_user` structure

To allow multi-touch events to be passed through from client to server where
supported, an additional `touch` instruction has been defined within the
Guacamole protocol to represent the state of an individual touch. A new
handler, `touch_handler`, is now present within the `guac_user` structure to
allow this instruction to be handled when received from the client. This change
affects the in-memory size of the `guac_user` structure.

Downstream usages of libguac which make use of `guac_user` will need to be
rebuilt to ensure that the structure sizes and memory offsets used are correct.

 * [GUACAMOLE-1204](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-1204) - Add support for RDP touch events (RDPEI)

### `guac_wol_wake()` now accepts a UDP port parameter

The `guac_wol_wake()` function now accepts an additional parameter defining the
UDP port to be used for the magic packet. This change affects the formal
arguments of `guac_wol_wake()`.

Downstream usages of libguac which make use of `guac_wol_wake()` will need to
be updated to include the port number and rebuilt. The UDP port used previously
for all calls to `guac_wol_wake()` was `9`, as defined by the `GUAC_WOL_PORT`
constant.

 * [GUACAMOLE-1245](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-1245) - Add configuration option to specify WOL port
