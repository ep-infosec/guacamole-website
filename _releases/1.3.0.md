The 1.3.0 release features support for automatically prompting users for their
remote desktop credentials, user group support for both CAS and OpenID, and
several bug fixes. For a full list of all changes in this release, please see
the [changelog](#changelog).

**The 1.3.0 release is compatible with older 1.x components.** You should
upgrade older components to 1.3.0 when possible, however things should continue
to work correctly in the interim:

* Extensions written for older 1.x releases can be used by 1.3.0.
* Components written for the version of the Guacamole protocol used by older
  1.x releases can be used with components of the 1.3.0 release.

Regardless of inter-component compatibility, **there are changes in 1.3.0 which
may affect downstream users of Guacamole's APIs and the Guacamole protocol**.
Please see the [deprecation / compatibility
notes](#deprecation--compatibility-notes) section for more information.


Automatic prompting for remote desktop credentials
--------------------------------------------------

Historically, Guacamole has required that remote desktop credentials either be
stored alongside connection configuration, passed through from web application
authentication (typically Active Directory), or retrieved interactively by the
remote desktop itself.

In addition to these methods, Guacamole will now automatically prompt the user
to enter any credentials not already provided by the administrator if those
credentials are required.


User group support for CAS and OpenID
-------------------------------------

If using a CAS or OpenID identity provider to automatically sign in your users,
user groups can now also be retrieved from the identity provider. Similar to
the support already present for SAML, this support allows the admininstrator to
define how user groups are exposed by the identity provider and allow those
user groups to affect the permissions granted to their members within
Guacamole.

Deprecation / Compatibility notes
=================================

Each 1.x release of Apache Guacamole should be compatible with components of
older 1.x releases. This compatibility is intended at the Guacamole protocol
level and at the extension level, but not necessarily at the API level. This
means:

 * Extensions from older 1.x releases should still work in binary form, but may
   need code changes before their source will build against a newer version of
   guacamole-ext.
 * Software which uses the Guacamole protocol of an older 1.x release should
   still work.
 * Software which uses libguac from an older 1.x release should still work by
   continuing to use the libguac from that release, as newer versions of
   libguac may not be API/ABI compatible. In the case of third-party protocol
   support plugins for guacd, this means that the guacd from that release must
   also be used. Compatibility with respect to libguac is represented by the
   [soname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soname).
 * You should update to newer versions where applicable and when possible.

As of 1.3.0, the following changes have been made which affect compatibility
with past releases:


Java API (guacamole-common) changes
-----------------------------------

### Implementations of `GuacamoleSocket` should now implement `getProtocol()`

The `required` and `argv` instructions both refer to connection parameters by
name. As it is the underlying protocol of a connection that determines the
semantics of connection parameters, client implementations will commonly need
to expose this information in some way. The mainline web application provided
by Apache Guacamole is one such implementation.

A new `getProtocol()` function has been added to `GuacamoleSocket` to
facilitate this, and implementations of `GuacamoleSocket` should aim to provide
implementations of this function with that in mind.

This will happen automatically for `ConfiguredGuacamoleSocket`.

 * [GUACAMOLE-221](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-221) - Parameter prompting within client interface


Extension API (guacamole-ext) changes
-------------------------------------

### Deprecation of `getHistory()` for `User` and `Connection` interfaces

The `User` and `Connection` interfaces have both continued to define a basic
`getHistory()` function for retrieving a raw list of history records. Unlike
the `getUserHistory()` and `getConnectionHistory()` functions exposed by the
`UserContext`, the `getHistory()` functions do not support filtering or
searching.

The old `getHistory()` functions have now been deprecated in favor of newer
functions that _do_ support filtering. Implementations that provide
`getHistory()` will continue to work, but should migrate to the new functions
when possible.

 * [GUACAMOLE-1123](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-1123) - Standardize on filtered history query for user and connection management


Guacamole protocol changes
--------------------------

### The new `required` instruction

To allow the server to request that the client provide credentials (or any
other parameters), a new `required` instruction has been added to the Guacamole
protocol. This instruction informs the client that one or more connection
parameters need to be specified for the connection to continue. If the client
indicated support for the `required` instruction during the initial connection
handshake, the client is then expected to supply values for each of these
parameters using `argv` streams.

 * [GUACAMOLE-221](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-221) - Parameter prompting within client interface


libguac API changes
-------------------

### `protocol_version` added to `guac_user_info` structure

A new `protocol_version` member has been added to `guac_user_info` to allow
implementations to make decisions based on the Guacamole protocol version in
use, affecting the size of this structure.

Additionally, because `guac_user_info` forms a part of `guac_user`, this change
also affects the memory offsets of members of the `guac_user` structure which
follow the `info` member, such as `data` and various instruction handlers.

Downstream usages of libguac which make use of `guac_user` or `guac_user_info`
will need to be rebuilt to ensure that the structure sizes and memory offsets
used are correct.
