title: Private tunnel identifier may be included in the non-private details of active connections
cve:   CVE-2021-41767
fixed: 1.4.0
---

Apache Guacamole 1.3.0 and older may incorrectly include a private tunnel
identifier in the non-private details of some REST responses. This may allow an
authenticated user who already has permission to access a particular connection
to read from or interact with another user's active use of that same
connection.
