title: Improper input validation of RDP static virtual channels
cve:   CVE-2020-9497
fixed: 1.2.0
---

Apache Guacamole 1.1.0 and older do not properly validate data received from
RDP servers via static virtual channels. If a user connects to a malicious or
compromised RDP server, specially-crafted PDUs could result in disclosure of
information within the memory of the guacd process handling the connection.
