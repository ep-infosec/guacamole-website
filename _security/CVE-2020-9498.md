title: Dangling pointer in RDP static virtual channel handling
cve:   CVE-2020-9498
fixed: 1.2.0
---

Apache Guacamole 1.1.0 and older may mishandle pointers involved in processing
data received via RDP static virtual channels. If a user connects to a
malicious or compromised RDP server, a series of specially-crafted PDUs could
result in memory corruption, possibly allowing arbitrary code to be executed
with the privileges of the running guacd process.
