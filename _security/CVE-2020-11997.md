title: Inconsistent restriction of connection history visibility
cve:   CVE-2020-11997
fixed: 1.3.0
---

Apache Guacamole 1.2.0 and older do not consistently restrict access to
connection history based on user visibility. If multiple users share access to
the same connection, those users may be able to see which other users have
accessed that connection, as well as the IP addresses from which that
connection was accessed, even if those users do not otherwise have permission
to see other users.

reporting this issue.
